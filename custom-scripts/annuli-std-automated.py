Description: given a folder filled with .fits RDI simulations, for each simulation create a standard deviation (STD) 
plot with a filename based on the simulation

Notes: 
possible update for public users' experience -- instead of asking for aperture_in_meters just ask for the instrument (nircam, miri) 
and the added mask (lyot,pupil,bar) and have default hard-coded values based on what the user inputs

    mostly created this function for my (klaus') own conceptual understanding
    this function answers the question 'where should the box-ring region start and stop?'
    utilizing lambda/d ='wavelength-observing-in'/'effective aperture of science instrument'

    Args:
        wavelength (float): complete path to file of interest

    Returns:
        lambda_over_d: the pixel value of lambda/d to be used as a spacing 
        constant when finding the box-ring pixel subset around a specific pixel

example usage:
an observation taken at 4.5 micron, so lambda = 4.5e-6 m
D for JWST is nominally ~6.5m, but for NIRCam coronagraphy the effective diameter is reduced due to 
the Lyot stop (see Figure 3 here: https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-near-infrared-camera/nircam-instrumentation/nircam-coronagraphic-occulting-masks-and-lyot-stops). In this case, itâ€™s closer to ~5.2m.
lambda/D = 4.5e-6 / 5.2 = 8.65e-7, in radians
need to convert to useful units for simulation data
radians > degrees > arcseconds > pixels
8.65e-7 radians * 180/pi * 3600 arcseconds = 0.178 arcseconds
The NIRCam long wavelength channel pixel scale is 1 pixel per 0.063 arcseconds (https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-near-infrared-camera/nircam-instrumentation/nircam-detector-overview). 
0.178 arcseconds / 0.063 arcseconds =~ 2.82 pixels
